# Horiseon HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

As a marketing agency, the client wanted adjustments made to their existing code
so it would follow accessibility standards and optimize the site for search engines.

To fulfil the clients brief, I replaced non semantic HTML elements for semantic ones such as replacing div with section, adding main and also replaced the the background img div with a figure tag so to be able to include a img discription without having to move the existing background image code (under class hero) to HTML which although it worked, the background img became slightly stretched so had to find a better way to include the img description.

I also: 

-Added and id to search-engine-optimization so the anchor would work correctly.

-Tidied up the CSS by grouping some classes together so to not have to repeat code. 

-Changed the title to something more inkeeping wth the site.

-Included proper HTML page structure by using semantic tags header, nav, aside and footer.

-Changed the footer h2 to h4 so headers correctly descended

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondary noteworthy changes:

-I added an alt to the h1 header in case of failure.

-Added smooth scroll so the user find it less darting.

-This last one which I also feel was an improvement and important is I changed the colour of the aside to improve the contrast/readability.
